# Skulls - TODO list

## the random list
* coreboot: x230: add bootsplash image when using SeaVGABIOS / native graphics init
* find legal information on Intel's VGA bios binary
* add support for the X1 carbon, 1st generation or similar Laptops
* create a live USB Linux for flashing including Skulls, flashrom and iomem=relaxed

## why this list
While we use [Github issue](https://github.com/merge/skulls/issues) for tracking
TODOs, we want to be somewhat independent of Github. The main repository is
mirrored to [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/skulls/skulls) for example.
This should hold a high-level summary of things that we want to do.
